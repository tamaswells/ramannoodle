Welcome to ramannoodle's documentation!
===================================

**ramannoodle** is a Python library facilitating (relatively) fast generation of Raman spectra from molecular dynamics trajectories. 

For now, this library interfaces only with VASP. This library also has a name which is very funny.



It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

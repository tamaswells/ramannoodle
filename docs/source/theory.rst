Theory
======

A system's Raman spectrum is related to the frequencies at which the components of the dielectric tensor fluctuate with time. 




Therefore, to calculate a Raman spectrum from a molecular dynamics trajectory, one needs to derive a timeseries of the dielectric tensor. This could be done by calculating the dielectric tensor at every molecular dynamics timestep. However, this is computationally *extremely* expensive. Instead, ramannoodle approximates this timeseries by assuming each atom has an independent effect on the dielectric constant dependent on that atom's displacement from it's equilibrium position. 



Symmetry
========

A major advantage of the assumption of independent effects of atoms means that the crystal symmetry can be leveraged to reduce the number of dielectric tensor calculations required. Assuming a space group symmetry given by the tensor A. Then considering a site vector B. Equilivalent sites B can be generated by applying that symmetry operations. Similarly, considering the B + d (the site vector plus a displacement). Applying the symmetry optations will give ABAt + Ad wit the dielectric displacement given by xxx. The dielectric tensor will not change under the symmetry operation, and we will therefore be the left with the transformed dielectric displacement in a new direction. In this way, the displacements can be populated for the entire structure.
